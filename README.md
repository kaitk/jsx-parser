# next-jsx-parser

**Warning: This software is pre-alpha and provided as is**

A React 18 and Server Component compatible JSX Parser

This library is based (more of a copy paste) on: [react-jsx-parser](https://github.com/TroyAlford/react-jsx-parser)
with minimaly changes to make it work with Server Components (not using deprecated React Components)

### Don't use it yet!

The Only reason for this to exist, is that it works on a small subset of components of an internal app to be rendered as [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components) in a Next.js 13.4 app.

### TODO

Tests and docs will be added later (if at all)
