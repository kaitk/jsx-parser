# jsx-parser

A React 18 and Server Component compatible JSX Parser

### Warning!

**This software is pre-alpha and provided as is**

The Only usecase it covers is to allow a small subset of components of an internal app to be rendered as Server Components in a next 13.4 app.

Tests and docs will be added later (if at all)
